{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/((?!api/|.*\\..*).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}```

**3. Deploy the changes:**
Commit this new `vercel.json` file to your Git repository and push it. Vercel will automatically trigger a new deployment with the updated configuration.

### How This `vercel.json` Rule Works

*   `"rewrites": [...]`: This tells Vercel to apply URL rewriting rules.
*   `"source": "/((?!api/|.*\\..*).*)"`: This is a regular expression that defines which incoming paths to match. It essentially means:
    *   Match any path (`/.*`).
    *   **EXCEPT** if it starts with `/api/` (for serverless functions, which you aren't using but is good practice to include).
    *   **AND** **EXCEPT** if it contains a dot (`.`), which indicates it's a request for a specific file like `index.css`, a `.js` file, or an image (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.). We want those to be served directly.
*   `"destination": "/index.html"`: For any path that matches the source rule, Vercel will serve the `index.html` file as the response.

Once your project is redeployed with this file, navigating to **https://bar-jukebox-live.vercel.app/dj?djMode=true** will work correctly.
